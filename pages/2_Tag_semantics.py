 At first glance, it's evident that "vlog" is the most popular tag, 
 towering over others with its usage count nearing over the 250,000 
 mark. This is followed by tags like "funny" and "family" which suggests a significant
 number of content creators focus on family-oriented material.
 Notably, there is a lexical variation in the tags used, i.e. "vlog", 
"vlogger", "vlogging", "vlogger", and "vlogs", which essentially refer to the same concept 
but differ in their grammar. 
This reflects an interesting aspect of tagging behavior where creators use different forms of 
a word to maximize visibility across search queries. \n

The tags "love" and "kids" are also quite prevalent, 
indicating a trend towards family and everyday life content. 
The presence of "review" and "daily" suggests a strong 
inclination towards regular content updates and product or 
experience reviews, which are important content strategies 
for engaging viewers. Further down the list, the tags "video," "fitness," "life," 
"health," and "makeup" appear, each with decreasing frequency 
but still significant in numbers. These tags represent niche 
areas within the broader People & Blogs category, from lifestyle
and wellness to beauty tutorials. \n

Enter: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a sophisticated topic modeling technique within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that can be used 
to discover the main topics within a corpus of text data. In short, LDA is probabilistic model that interprets a collection of data (such as a set of tags in our context) 
and yields a distribution of categories across the elements being analyzed. Although it resembles a clustering algorithm in some ways, LDA fundamentally differs by assigning 
probabilities indicating the likelihood of a tag being associated with a specific topic, rather than just placing it in a cluster. 
If you're interested in the math behind LDA, have a look at this [link](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/08/a-brief-introduction-to-linear-discriminant-analysis/)!\n
